\(t\) denotes a discrete time step.
\(b\Tt\) is the value of variable~\(b\) at time~\(t\).
When unambiguous, \(b\), \(b\nxt\), and~\(b\prv\) are short notations for~\(b\Tt\), \(b\Tp\), and~\(b\Tm\) respectively.

\(\distribover{\cB}\) is the set of distributions over finite set~\(\cB\).
For~\(\beta \in \distribover{\cB}\), \(B \drawn \beta\) denotes that the random variable~\(B\) is drawn according to distribution~\(\beta\).
\(\probaof[\beta]{E}\) is the probability of event~\(E\) under distribution~\(\beta\).
\(\beta \elmt {b}\) denotes the quantity~\(\probaof[\beta]{B = b}\).
